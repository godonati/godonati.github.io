    <p>Her company has experienced rapid growth, and while they have strong copyright material and content assets, they struggle to keep up with the demand for high-quality, diverse video content at a fast pace. Emma has limited resources in-house and outsourcing to third-party video creators often yields inconsistent results.</p>

    <p>Video Output per Week</p>

    <span>Objective</span>
    <p>Measure the total number of videos produced per week to ensure the platform is meeting production targets.</p>

    <span>Formula</span>
    <p>Total Number of Completed Videos / Week</p>

    <span>Target</span>
    <p>Baseline: 5 videos per week (before implementing the platform) <br>
        Target: 50 videos per week (after implementing the platform)</p>

    <span>Frequency</span>
    <p>Measured weekly</p>

    <span>Why it's important</span>
    <p>This KPI tracks the primary goal of increasing video production throughput, which directly impacts the company’s ability to run multiple marketing campaigns, test various formats, and increase sales through advertising. A higher video output demonstrates the platform’s efficiency in managing editors and producing content at scale.</p>

    <span>Success Criteria</span>
    <p>Achieving at least 50 videos per week within the first 3 months of platform implementation. <br>
        Maintaining consistent output even during peak demand periods.
